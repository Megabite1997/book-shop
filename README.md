# MVC Pattern

MVC is all about "Separation of Concerns", the different parts of your code do different things, which part is responsible for what.

## MVC stands for 
- ### Models --> represent your data in your code and work with your data(e.g. save, fetch).
- ### Views --> are what the users see, and send back HTML to the users.
- ### Controllers --> are the connection point between models and views.
