# MVC Pattern

MVC is all about "Separation of Concerns", the different parts of your code do different things, which part is responsible for what.

## MVC stands for 
- Models
- Views
- Controllers

- Models represent your data in your code, work with your data(e.g. save, fetch).
- Views are what the users see, send back html to the users.
- Controllers are the connection point between models and views.
